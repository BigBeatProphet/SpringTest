# SpringTest

# What is this ?
My own testing ground, where I will first try out and revise some parts of my older projects using the Spring framework. Secondly, I will create and test some new exciting features such as WebGL.

# Why ?
Because I want to learn and try new things, gain specific knowledge, and dive deeper into computer science.

# What to expect ?
At this point, I have some older UML diagrams that were created with whitestarUML and will need to be re-created as they will need to be updated in the future. I will need some time to extract the information from them, which I currently don't have. After that, I will take a few days to think about the technical specifications and then start the process of updating my project.
