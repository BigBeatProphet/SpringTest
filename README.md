# SpringTest

# What is this ?
My own testing ground, where I will first try out and revise some parts of my older projects using the Spring framework. Secondly, I will create and test some new exciting features such as WebGL.

# Why ?
Because I want to learn and try new things, gain specific knowledge, and dive deeper into computer science.

# What to expect ?
At this point, I have a few older UML diagrams that I will need to rewrite at some point in the future. After that, I will wait a few days for the technical specifications, and then, after all that, I will start the process of rewriting and updating my project.
